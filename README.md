## Bubble Map Challenge

This repository is a solution for a Bubble Map Challenge in an internship application. The full goal, constraints, and deliverables are designated below.

###Goal

Write a program that will read in an input file (or via standard input or something) consisting of comma separated value/name lines. 

E.g.

130,thing1

200,thing2

310,otherthing

40,yetanother

The program will then generate and display a packed bubble chart; it will draw a circle for each line with a radius corresponding to the value from that line, all the circles together in one bunch, touching each
other but not overlapping.

###Constraints

The program can be written in any language of your choice (we recommend Java or a .NET language)

The program should run on Windows or Linux.

You are allowed and encouraged to cut & paste sample code found online, but you must keep track of where all your sample code came from and give us a list of URL’s or copy of original sources you used.

You may not simply import a library and call a library function to do the task for you.

Don’t worry about formatting of either the program or your notes.

###Deliverables

The program source, binaries, and build instructions

Include with the program your notes or writeup in any common file format (.txt, .pdf...) that explains
how your algorithm and program works.
